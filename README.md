# Hadoop-MapReduce
Developed a Hadoop MapReduce job using Java to analyze a dataset provided by my professor. 
Specifically, the job consisted of three mappers and one reducer that were used to count the number of producers who acted in their own films between 1950 and 1995.
The use of Java was a requirement of the system, and the job was executed within a Hadoop cluster
